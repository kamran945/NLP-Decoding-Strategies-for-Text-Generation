# NLP-Decoding-Strategies-for-Text-Generation
* Text generation models are a class of natural language processing (NLP) models designed to automatically generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on a given input prompt. 

* **Use Cases**:
    * **Content Creation**
    * **Summarization**
    * **Dialogue Systems**
    * **Creative Writing**
    * **Code Generation**


* This notebook is just a demo showcasing different decoding strategies. It is crucial to experiment with both the model and decoding method to find what works best for your use case.

* This notebook demonstrates the use of a specific model for text generation from huggingface. It is important to remember that different models may be better suited for specific datasets or tasks.
